# Picture Search By Geolocation

## Description 
Write a responsive application that search for pictures using Flickr API, based on user input and present the results. 

## Frameworks
We prioritise React or Angular2+
You can use any third party CSS frameworks to make your life easier. 

## Challenge Specification
This challenge is designed to test your ability to write code that inter-operates with a third-party API as well as develop a simple user interface.

The user should be able to:

- Search for a location, and see the thumbnails of the first 10 photos available for that location. Navigation should be available to get the next 10 photos
- Perform a search either by entering latitude and longitude, or selecting a location from a preset list. Locations in the preset list should be represented by a human-readable name.
- Add entries to the preset list by supplying a longitude, latitude and name. This list should be stored in the app's temporary storage or local storage.
- Add photos in a search result to a favourites list. This list should be stored in the app's temporary storage or local storage.
- View thumbnails of the photos in the favourite list

**You do not need to provide individual user profiles, logins or store favourites on a per-user basis. Assume a single-user system.

## What we are looking for
How you design and structure an application given a set of requirements.
How you build maintainable code.
How does the final result look like and the user experience is considered.

## Build/Run
Use any build tools you prefer;
We want to easily run your application, so provide a brief description on how to build, run and test your project.
Bonus points are given for how well you present this projects documentation.

## Hints
We don't have any time limit for this test, but we believe you can finish it within one or two days.
We would like to see a production quality project. Keep in mind edge cases and error handling. Let us see your understanding of it from code, build process and view design/layout point of views.
